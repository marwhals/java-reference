# GraalVM

- Alternative to the standard JVM which should provide better performance and more.
  - Only for Linux and Mac
- Some features are already available in the standard JDK

## About the GraalVM
- Faster than the standard JVM for running java byte code
- Provides an alternative Java compiler and this might produce more performant byte code
- â€¼ Can use GraalVM to natively compile Java code to software that will run natively on a given computer
  - Means you don't need to install a JVM to run the code -> result: code will run faster
  - run `native-image` command to compile
- **Out of date** Using the Graal Compiler with OpenJDK11 on Linux
  - `XX:+UnlockExperimentalVMOptions`
  - `XX:+EnableJVMCI`
  - `XX:+UseJVMCICompiler`

# Using other JVM Languages
### Kotlin vs Java - Kotlin doesn't have any primitives
- Object types have to be used
  - These will become byte code anyway
  - Var vs Val - Just a design time constraint
  - Variables can never be `NULL`

*Can use javap file to see the differences in byte code*

*See Oracle Docs*

### Can disassemble bytecode back into Java
Example tool - CFR
