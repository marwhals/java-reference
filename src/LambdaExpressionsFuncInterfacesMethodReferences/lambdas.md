# Lambdas

- Can be thpight of as a shorthand for an anonomous class that implements a fuinctional interfgace - an interface that implements a single abstract method.
- --- This makes code more concise and easier to understand
- Allows for the passing of blocks of code as parameters, offering a clean and flexible way to write clean and more functional code with little effort
- --- Can simplify tasks
- --- Method refences bulid on this conept providing an even more concise way to refere to existing methods using lambda expression syntax

# The syntax of a lambda expression
-- A lambda expression consists of a formal parameter list,usualy but not always declared in parenthese, the arrow and eithe ran expression or a code block after the arrow

# Functional interfaces
- A functional interface is an interface that has exactly one abstract method
- A functional interface is the target type for a lambda expression
