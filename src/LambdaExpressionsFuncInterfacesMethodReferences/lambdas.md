# Lambdas

- Can be thought of as a shorthand for an anonymous class that implements a functional interface - an interface that implements a single abstract method.
  - This makes code more concise and easier to understand
- Allows for the passing of blocks of code as parameters, offering a clean and flexible way to write clean and more functional code with little effort
  - Can simplify tasks
  - Method references build on this concept providing an even more concise way to refer to existing methods using lambda expression syntax

# The syntax of a lambda expression
- A lambda expression consists of a formal parameter list, usually but not always declared in parentheses, the arrow and either ran expression or a code block after the arrow

# Functional interfaces
- A functional interface is an interface that has exactly one abstract method
- A functional interface is the target type for a lambda expression
